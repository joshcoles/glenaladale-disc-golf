		"description": "It‚Äôs a very well designed course. I cannot wait to see what it develops into when the fairways grow in and the footing allows for run ups. My feet are small and I was worried about rolling ankles so did standstill throwing after the tee. Beautiful course. I find it hard to believe that it only opened in 2022!"
