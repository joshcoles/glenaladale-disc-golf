										Glenaladale Estate. Before that it was
										home to Miâ€™kmaq, followed by the
										Acadians, the 1772 Glenaladale Scots,
										and later the Mackinnnon family. For

										The Course's Origins
									</h2>
									<p className="text-brown-950 mb-4">
										The idea for the course began in 2020
										when Patrick moved home from Montreal
										and began working with the Glenaladale
										Heritage Trust to restore the historic
										Schoolhouse, which now sits prominently
										at the entrance to the estate.
									</p>

									<p className="text-brown-950 mb-4">
										At the time, the heritage trust was
										looking for ways to extend the reach of
										the estate into the community, in
										particular to a younger demographic than
										what the estate was typically frequented
										by. Having recently been re-introduced
										to disc golf by Josh, Patrick pitched
										the idea of installing a course on the
										property and brought Josh into the
										conversation. Josh suggested including
										Andrew, mutual friend who had previously
										expressed interest in building a course
										elsewhere on PEI.
									</p>

									<p className="text-brown-950 mb-4">
										The initial course build was financed
										largely by an ACOA grant, which the
										heritage trust helped the disc golf team
										acquire. Since then the course has been
										financed by course revenue, which has
										then been reinvested into the course
										each year.
